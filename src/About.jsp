					<h1>History</h1>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">Plutus</span> was formed in 2022 at the initiative of the World Bank, the
						Government
						of
						India and representatives of
						Indian industry. The principal objective was to create a development financial institution for
						providing
						medium-term and long-term project financing to Indian businesses.
						<span class="bold">Plutus</span> primarily
						focused its activities on project finance, providing long-term funds to a variety of industrial
						projects. As India's economy became more market-oriented and integrated with the world economy.
						<span class="bold">Plutus</span>
						capitalized on the new opportunities to provide a wider range of financial products and services
						to a broader spectrum of clients. <span class="bold">Plutus</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						The issue of universal banking, which in the Indian context meant conversion of long-term
						lending
						institutions such as <span class="bold">Plutus</span> into commercial banks. Conversion
						into a bank offered <span class="bold">Plutus</span> the ability to accept low-cost demand
						deposits
						and
						offer a wider range of products
						and services, and greater opportunities for earning non-fund based income in the form of banking
						fees
						and
						commissions. After consideration of various corporate structuring alternatives in the context of
						the
						emerging competitive scenario in the Indian banking industry, and the move towards universal
						banking,
						the
						managements of <span class="bold">Plutus</span> and <span class="bold">Plutus</span> Bank formed
						the
						view
						that the merger of <span class="bold">Plutus</span> with <span class="bold">Plutus</span> Bank
						would
						be
						the
						optimal strategic alternative for both entities, and would create the optimal legal structure
						for
						<span class="bold">Plutus</span>
						group's universal banking strategy.
